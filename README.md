  ## Description
  This app is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This restaurant app lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page. When the user clicks the 'Devour' button, the burger will move to the right side of the page and the app will store every burger in the database wether devoured or not.
